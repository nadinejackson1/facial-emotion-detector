# Facial Emotion Detector

This project is a Facial Emotion Detector built using Python, Tensorflow, and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com/nadinejackson1/facial-emotion-detector), with images labeled with seven different emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

The objective of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict the emotion on a human face in an image.
